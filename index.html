        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Welcome; Willkmmen; ようこそ! Passionate about higher education and technology, my background is an
          interconnected career path. Blending my executive; learning and software expertise, my objective is
          combining three interrelated disciplines; a) Project Management (implementation); b) Human
          Centric-Design (collaboration); and, c) Strategic Organizational Behavior (leadership) towards developing
          data-focused products; and, creating applications for both technical end-users and non-technical
          audiences in a remote-role as a part of a dynamic, global team.</p>

        <p>Paying-it-forward: During the US Subprime Financial Crisis, transitioning from an IT Executive to Higher Ed
          availed me the opportunity to give back and weather this major economic downturn. With an MBA, as an
          undergraduate professor while teaching in Asia; concurrently, I earned a second master’s degree (Teaching),
          and, then, a Doctorate of Education, Organizational Change and Leadership (OCL) from the University of Southern
          California (USC). Researching and writing my dissertation expanded interests in data analysis; visualization;
          UX design and rekindled my (long-standing) desire to learn coding.</p>

        <p>"Prior to this course, I trusted almost everything in media... I just received things
          or knowledge without question... I am thankful I took your class; learned and improved
          my critical thinking skills.</p>

        <p>"...because I want to express my gratitude... you always gave me a new perspective
          and I was inspired by your lectures. In every class, I always gained some knowledge or
          practical skills as you gave us the opportunity to think about our own responsibilities as scholars..."</p>

        <p>"I appreciate everything you have done for us. Thank you very much."</p>

        <p>"Thank you for all of your helpful advice."</p>

        <p>"Thank you again for the great lectures you have given me. You have been a great teacher
          and a great mentor!"</p>

        <p>"Having taken your class and thoroughly enjoying each and every session, I sincerely believe that it
          helped to think critically. I really believe that the subjects covered by you in the class on Global
          Business Cultures could be taken up by anyone irrespective of the field/discipline and help them refine their
          approach towards society and enhance their decision-making."</p>

        <p>"To conclude, I would like to say thank you again for your help and mentorship... Because you helped me
          grow so much and guided me in the right direction.., I was able to successfully transfer to... where I
          was able to so fortunately work as a research assistant for four professors in the management department, the
          experience of which was arguably the most critical factor in getting accepted to the Ph.D. program of my
          choice on a full-scholarship."</p>
